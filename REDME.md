# Twitter UI Clone

This repository contains a clone of the Twitter web application interface, created using HTML and Tailwind CSS. I made this project to showcase my skills in web development and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Accurate Clone**: Mimics the layout and style of the Twitter web app.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dineshshinde-4-27/Twitter-Ui-.git
   ```
